1: dataset (compas-scores.csv)
2: DI c_charge_degree: disparate impact on level of previous conviction (Felony or Misdemeanor). 2 versions. one uploaded version where the results from the modelling are visable, and one written in github with sources
3: Equalized Odds calculation
4: and a document where the influence of race on the recidivism score is visable.
